## 🧪 Labs Overview

Each lab focuses on a different aspect of NLP:

### 🔹 Lab 1 – Data Analysis with Pandas
- Learn the foundations of data analysis using the **Pandas** library, tailored for working with text datasets.

### 🔹 Lab 2 – Building an NLP Pipeline
- **Dataset**: Twitter  
- **Tasks**:
  - Raw text preprocessing
  - Cleaning and normalization
  - Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF feature extraction

### 🔹 Lab 3 – Regex and Word Embedding
- Use **Regular Expressions** for text pattern extraction.
- Apply **Word2Vec** to capture semantic meaning through word embeddings.

### 🔹 Lab 4 – Data-Centric vs Model-Centric Approaches
- **Focus**: Product review classification (magazine category)
- Understand the difference between:
  - **Data-centric** approaches: improving data quality
  - **Model-centric** approaches: enhancing model performance

### 🔹 Lab 5 – Topic Modeling Using LDA
- Learn how to uncover hidden topics in a text corpus using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**.

### 🔹 Lab 6 – Generative AI Use Case
- **Task**: Summarize dialogues
- Leverage **generative models** to understand and compress conversational content.

## 🧾 Final Project – Fake News Detection

This project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for detecting fake news.

### 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle Fake News Dataset (labeled real vs fake articles)

### 🛠️ Techniques Used
- **Text Representation**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec  
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, XGBoost  
- **Advanced Modeling**: BERT-based topic modeling  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, and other performance indicators

### ✅ Key Findings
- **XGBoost** and **LSTM** models achieved high accuracy and strong generalization.
- Combining traditional ML with DL techniques improves detection performance significantly.
